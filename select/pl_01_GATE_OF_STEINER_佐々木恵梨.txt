"Time" is so sad and fleeting
Can't be controlled,
like a river, never stops
"Space" is emptiness dark
and so cold
Can you define it's presence,
does it exist?
We drift through the heavens
果てない想い
Filled with the love
from up above
He guides my travels
せまる刻限
Shed a tear and leap
to a new world
Cosmos and their creation
Tell me do they
exist for infinity
Stars burn,
burning so bright
but they'll fade
How will I know?
Secrets kept until I die
Defy my destiny
守りたいもの
Foolish , but it's humanity
Imagination
奇跡に変える
Things you can't conceive
Revelation!
A drop in the darkness
小さな命
Unique and precious forever
Bittersweet
memories?
夢幻の刹那
Make this moment last,
last forever
We drift through the heavens
果てない想い
Filled with the love
from up above
He guides my travels
せまる刻限
Shed a tear and leap
to a new world
