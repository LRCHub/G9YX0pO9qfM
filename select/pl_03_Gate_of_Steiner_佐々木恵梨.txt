"Time" is so sad and fleeting
Can't be controlled,
like a river, never stops
"Space" is
emptiness dark and so cold
Can you define it's presence,
does it exist?
We drift through the heavens
果てない想い
Filled with the love
from up above
He guides my travels せまる刻限
Shed a tear and leap
to a new world
A drop in the darkness 小さな命
Unique and precious forever
Bittersweet memories 夢幻の刹那
Make this moment last,
last forever
We drift through the heavens
果てない想い
Filled with the love
from up above
He guides my travels せまる刻限
Shed a tear and leap
to a new world
