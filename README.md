# 佐々木恵梨 – Gate OF STEINER

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Time is so sad and fleeting
Can't be controlled, like a river, never stops
Space is emptiness dark and so cold
Can you define it's presence, does it exist?
We drift through the heavens hatenai omoi
Filled with the love from up above
He guides my travels semaru kokugen
Shed a tear and leap to a new world
Cosmos and their creation
Tell me do they exist for infinity
Stars burn, burning so bright but they'll fade
How will I know?
Secrets kept until I die
Defy my destiny mamoritai mono
Foolish, but it's humanity
Imagination kiseki ni kaeru
Things you can't conceive
Revelation!
A drop in the darkness chiisana inochi
Unique and precious forever
Bittersweet memories? mugen no setsuna
Make this moment last, last forever
We drift through the heavens hatenai omoi
Filled with the love from up above
He guides my travels semaru kokugen
Shed a tear and leap to a new world
